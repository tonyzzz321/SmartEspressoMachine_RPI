Instruction of Zeroconf Hostname for Android App auto ip detection
(maybe make a script to do it automatically later)

1. Install dependencies avahi-daemon, libnss-mdns:
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon libnss-mdns

2. Add this line to /etc/nsswitch.conf:
   hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4

3. Create a new file called sem.service in /etc/avahi/services/ with the following content:
   
   <?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?><!--*-nxml-*-->
   <!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd">
   <service-group>
     <name replace-wildcards="yes">%h</name>
     <service>
        <type>_sem._tcp</type>
        <port>9999</port>
     </service>
   </service-group>

   This make the pi broadcast itself as _sem._tcp in the local network. Android app can search for this to identify the Smart Espresso Machine and its ip to connect to it.

4. Restart avahi-daemon service:
   sudo service avahi-daemon restart

5. Profit!
